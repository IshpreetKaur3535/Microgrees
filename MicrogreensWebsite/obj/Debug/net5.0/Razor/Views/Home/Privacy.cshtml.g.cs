    The local farmer produces microgreens (Young seedlings of edible vegetables and
    herbs are known as microgreens) in their farm, but they could not manage to sell them
    all and left over gets damaged or eaten by the animals. Basically, they are not able to
    make any type of profit from their farm.

    To resolve this issue the group of local farmers have decided to start a brick-andmortar
    store where they can sell all the products together under a one roof. They call
    themselves a Microgreenâ€™s. Microgreens has approached software developer to develop their
    stock management website where they can manage their incoming and outgoing stock.
